fix: resolve critical import issues and update dependencies

CRITICAL FIXES:
- Fixed all import paths to use relative imports (from .module)
- Updated requirements.txt: added python-docx>=0.8.11, PyPDF2>=3.0.0
- Removed duplicate pypdf2 entry from requirements.txt
- Fixed config import in utils.py
- Fixed inline imports in all tool modules

IMPACT:
- Tests passing: 33/37 (89% pass rate, up from 0%)
- All import errors resolved
- Remaining 4 test failures are test-specific (missing tavily mock)

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/agent.py: Fixed imports for tools and db_manager
- src/utils.py: Fixed config import
- src/tools/*.py: Fixed all imports to use relative paths
- requirements.txt: Added missing deps, removed duplicates

TESTING:
- Verified with: python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
- Result: 33 passed, 4 failed (test environment issues only)
